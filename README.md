# Static Node and Express Site

This is a site that utilizes Node, Express and Pug to create a web developer portfolio site. This is the 6th project for Treehouse's Full Stack JavaScript TechDegree.

## CSS changes

1. Changed .portfolio-me a, .portfolio-breadcrumb a, and .portfolio-index .thumbnail hover state box shadow.
2. Added a transition duration of .2s and .3s for these items.
3. Changed font for entire body to Google's PT Serif. Removed individual fonts for specific tags, but kept Foundation fonts for headers (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
4. Use AOS library for fade effect on project images (this is mostly for mobile).
